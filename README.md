How I Managed to Install Epic Games Store on My iPad

This method works only if you’re in the EU, and it’s for users facing the same issue I encountered.

Steps I followed:
	1.	Connect your iPad and Mac: I connected my iPad to my Mac using a USB cable.
	2.	Use Safari Developer Tools:
	•	On my Mac, I opened Safari and enabled the Develop menu (if it’s not enabled, go to Safari Preferences → Advanced → Check “Show Develop menu in the menu bar”).
	•	In the Develop menu, I selected my iPad under the “Devices” section and chose to Inspect the webpage opened on my iPad.
	3.	Modify the Web Page:
	•	Once I was able to inspect the page, I changed the user agent to an iOS device on Safari on my Mac (I copied the user agent string from the “Inspect” tab in Safari’s developer tools).
	•	I added the download button that I found by inspecting the page and pasted the necessary HTML code to make the button work on my iPad.
	4.	Follow Epic Games’ Installation Steps:
	•	After modifying the page, I followed the usual steps for installation as per the instructions provided by Epic Games.

By connecting my iPad to the Mac and using Safari’s developer tools, I was able to bypass some issues I encountered and successfully add the installation button for the Epic Games Store.
